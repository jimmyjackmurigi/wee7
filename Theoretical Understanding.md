Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)
âœ… 1. Short Answer Questions
ðŸŸ© Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.
Answer:

Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in an AI system that create unfair outcomes, such as privileging one group over another.

Examples:

Hiring Tools: Amazonâ€™s AI recruitment system favored male candidates because it was trained on resumes submitted over 10 yearsâ€”which were mostly from men.

Predictive Policing: Some tools used in U.S. law enforcement falsely flagged Black individuals as high-risk for reoffending at disproportionately higher rates.

ðŸŸ© Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?
Answer:

Transparency is about how openly the AI systemâ€™s structure, data, and algorithms are shared and documented.

Explainability refers to how easily humans can understand the decisions an AI system makes.

Importance:

Without transparency, it's hard to trust or regulate the system.

Without explainability, users and affected people canâ€™t understand or challenge outcomesâ€”especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare or criminal justice.

ðŸŸ© Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?
Answer:

GDPR directly influences AI development by:

Giving users the right to explanation for automated decisions.

Requiring data minimization, so only necessary data is used.

Mandating explicit consent before collecting or processing personal data.

Enforcing accountabilityâ€”developers must document how personal data is used and protected.

This forces developers to build privacy-respecting and transparent systems from the start.
